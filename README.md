Summary:
In my project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer tenure within the auto insurance industry using 12 months of survey data sourced from Kaggle.com. My objective was to identify the primary factors influencing customer tenure over a span of one or more years.
I utilized Power BI Desktop to create a comprehensive dashboard report based on the supplied dataset. My objectives included loading the datasets, performing necessary data cleaning and transformation procedures, and utilizing Power BI DAX to create required tables and metrics. I built a robust data model, establishing relationships based on key attributes to facilitate insightful analysis. Multiple report pages (dashboards) were created to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), with varied formatting options applied for clarity and aesthetics. Upon completion, the report was published to Power BI services and configured for auto-refresh to ensure up-to-date data availability. Finally, a dashboard was created in Power BI services based on the published report, providing users with an intuitive and interactive interface for exploring insights derived from the data.
My findings provide valuable strategic insights for auto insurance companies seeking to enhance customer loyalty and optimize their business strategies.
